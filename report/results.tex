\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

This section provides the results of the CPU vs. GPU comparison, as well as the perfomance of the Transformer model on the translation task.

\subsection{GPU versus CPU training}

\cref{tab:comparison} illustrates the results of the perfomance comparison between CPU and GPU training.
The GPU significantly accelerates the overall training process by a facor of 8.07.
Accordingly, the GPU processes a single epoch, as well as a forward pass, faster by approximately the same margin.
The GPU achieves the most significant speed-up (20x) during the backward pass.
This highlights the GPU's superior efficiency in handling computationally expensive tasks, such as gradient computation, which heavily rely on parallelized matrix calculations.
Surprisingly, the GPU uses 38 times less memory per epoch compared to the CPU, which can mainly be attributed to the small batch size of 32 for both setups.\todo{why does that happen?} \\
Due to approaching deadlines and long queues on the high performance cluster, we abstain from further optimizations of the GPU codebase.
For instance, potential improvements like offloading BLEU score calculation to the CPU, and leveraging mixed precision (which is implemented in full model training), among other optimizations, could further improve performance.

Additionally, the A100 GPU has a memory bandwidth of 1555 GB/sec, meaning it can transfer data from the Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) at an exceptionally high rate compared to a CPU.
